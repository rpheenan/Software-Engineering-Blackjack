# Broc's Estimation for the project

I estimate the entire projet to be around 300 lines of code.

I believe that the project should take us 7 hours to complete distributed over a couple days of work.

# Ryan's estimation:

I think the project will be about 400 lines of code.

I think it will take about 10 hours all together to complete the project.

# Report
  For the learning and development process of the game we first wanted to make sure that both of us understood the concept of blackjack. Broc has been to a few casinos since turning 21 so Broc had a pretty good idea on the subject. Ryan did not know all the concepts of the game so first Broc worked on teaching Ryan all the cases of the game. For example, when the player wants to stop hitting for another card or when the player wants to take another card. Then explained all the ways the dealer can win. Then Broc was the person who has taken android so he taught Ryan how the concept of the Model View Controller works on the Android studio and how they all connect to one another. Then we first worked on writing the rules of Blackjack in the Blackjack.java file because we figured once we got at least the rules working then we can focus in on the technical stuff of making the app display properly. Once we got what we thought was most of what we needed in the Blackjack.java file then we started to work on the display of the app. This is where we ran into our first problem so we met with Dr. Franceschi. He helped us discover the bug that was not allowing us to display the app and then we went from there. Then we worked on cleaning up the xml file so that it looked nice before we did any of the setting of text and things of that nature. Then finally we worked on MainActivity.java and had it all working as one adhesive piece. Finally we had the model view controller concept in action. 

  For this project, we did the majority of the coding on Broc’s laptop. Thus, it was easiest if we commit everything from his GitHub account because he was already logged in. Ryan, however, did most of the coding on Broc’s laptop because he was the partner with less experience working on Android app development. Overall, we wrote about 640 lines of code (240 in blackjack file, 400 in Main Activity) and Ryan and wrote about 475 of these lines as he wrote all of the Blackjack file and over half of the Main activity file. Broc mainly wrote the lines related to displaying the cards, displaying the buttons and changing the state of the game (who won or lost) while Ryan wrote the lines for actually running the game. We split up the comments depending on wrote the lines of code near the comments. Finally, Ryan did a majority of the work with the xml file to gain some new experience with this type of file. 

  For our time commitment, we spent about 8 hours working on this assignment. The Blackjack file took us about 2 hours and the Main activity file took about 3 hours. 2 more hours were composed of debugging, writing comments and doing extra work for this project. We worked on the project together for the entirety of these 7 hours, but we also worked on the project separately for about 1 hour. This hour composed of making small changes to the app or thinking about the design of the next part of the project. Overall, since we felt like we had a good grasp on the rules of Blackjack and on App development, only about 20% of our total time was devoted to research and learning, while the other 80% was devoted to coding, testing, debugging and documentation.
