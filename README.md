Broc's Estimation for the project

I estimate the entire projet to be around 300 lines of code.

I believe that the project should take us 7 hours to complete distributed over a couple days of work.

Ryan's estimation:

I think the project will be about 400 lines of code.

I think it will take about 10 hours all together to complete the project.
